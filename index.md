## Introduction
The AR-Drums project was created as an educational music tool in mind that would teach users how to play drums in an augmented reality space. This software aims to teach basic drumming techniques and allow users to import their own custom drum beats they can play along to.

### Skills used to develop AR-Drums

AR-Drums is built mostly using C# as well as Github and Plastic SCM for source control. Unity was used as the game engine to import all our game objects into our main scene. Utilizing Blender to create a 3D model of a 5-piece drum kit that users would be able to interact with. As well as using the Open XR pluging to allow the engine to integrate VR and AR headset tracking.
